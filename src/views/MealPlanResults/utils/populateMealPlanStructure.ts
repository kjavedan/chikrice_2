  // meal 1 -> rice
  // meal 2 -> pasta
  // meal 3 -> potato
  // ? DAY 2
  // meal 1 -> beans
  // meal 2 -> rice
  // meal 3 -> potato
  // ? Is this practical ?
  // no
  // ? What is practical ?

    When it comes to what to eat it's always about preperation
    for example you are usually going to prepare either one type
    or some times you might prepare 2 types

    for me personally I like to have veraiety as well but it's not easy
    to prpare it all the times so that is way I go with the same thing
    every meal

    for example I go with rice and chicken 3 times a day 

    or I go with rice and fish 3 times a day

    or I go rice and beef 3 times a day

    and have eggs and bread when i don't have time or a protein shake

    what about the majority of people who I know 

    there could be only 5 to 10% of the people I know who have the 
    time to be creative and cook different meals all the time
    
    the majority of people don't have enough time to prepare a lot of food

    that is also true for me 

    what can I do to solve that problem for me and others ?

    I need to come up with solution that is simple and practical in the same time

    It should work and not just be a regular plan

    ! How?
    Before anything else I need to come up with plan that works for me
